  are `snt.Module` and `tf.contrib.rnn.RNNCell`.

  As with any other `snt.Module` any subclass must implement a `_build` method
  that constructs the graph that corresponds to a core. Such a `_build` method
  should always have the same interface, which is the following:

  This class is to be used with tensorflow containers such as `rnn` in
  tensorflow.python.ops.rnn. These containers only accept
  `tf.contrib.rnn.RNNCell` objects, hence the need to comply with its interface.
